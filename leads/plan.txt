- type the name of your targets, extract long and latitude of the first company that shows

look for social media handles. if a youtube account in present, you can perform a yt diagnosis

NOTES:
- ElementClickInterceptedException: span class="tXNTee L6Bbsd T7HQDc "
- Improve scrolling to prevent every other element being caught instead of every element,
- try to have every element in a sensibile viewing position instead of in between elements. Its being intercepted by
googles random pop up Back to top
- improve speed. i cut some things in half but more measures need to be taken
- see if you can get the driver to scrape data even if a new tab isnt opened
